            Nuclear Energy, at its core, is <b style="color: #EC4A2E;">steam</b> powered.<br><br>What this means is that when the evaporated water flows through a chamber which contains a turbine, the turbine is spun and energy is created.<br><br>This characteristic is shared with multiple different energy solutions..<br><br>The way the water is heated is what sets them apart.

            The water within the reactor is heated by a process called Nuclear <b style="color: #EC4A2E;">Fission</b><br><br>
            This process causes the nucleus of an atom of Uranium-235 to be split by bombarding it with neutrons and protons. <br><br> 
            This causes a controlled chain reaction, which creates large amounts of heat, therefore heating the water within the reactor.

                The Uranium-235(U-235 for short) is organized in fuel rods, which are made of of small ceramic pellets stacked and sealed into metal tubes. <br><br>
                These rods do not have an infinite lifespan. When the U-235 has been depleted, the rods are lowered deep into the earth and disposed of. <br><br>
                This is also known as <b style="color: #EC4A2E;">Nuclear Waste</b><br><br>
                While there are many misconceptions about this waste, these rods do no harm hundreds of feet below the surface and contained within their metal enclosures.
